**Malaikah** (plural of *Malak*) are divine beings created by Allah (God) from light. In Islam, they are not independent deities but obedient servants of Allah who carry out His commands.

Key beliefs about Malaikah include:

1.  **Creation from Light:** They are believed to be created from *Nur* (divine light).
2.  **Numerous in Number:** Their exact number is known only to Allah.
3.  **Diverse Roles:** They perform various tasks as commanded by Allah, such as:
    * **Messengers:** Relaying divine revelations to prophets (e.g., Jibril/Gabriel).
    * **Guardians:** Protecting individuals and places.
    * **Recorders:** Noting the deeds of humans.
    * **Enforcers:** Carrying out divine punishments.
    * **Worshippers:** Constantly glorifying and praising Allah.
4.  **Purity and Obedience:** They are pure beings, free from sin and in constant obedience to Allah.
5.  **Inability to Disobey:** Unlike humans and jinn, they have no free will to disobey Allah.

Belief in the existence of angels is a fundamental aspect of Islamic faith.
