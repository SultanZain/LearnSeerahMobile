**Seerah** refers to the life, character, and mission of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It includes his experiences in Mecca and Medina, his leadership, and his interactions with companions and communities.

Studying Seerah helps Muslims understand how Islamic teachings were practiced in real-life situations and provides guidance for personal conduct, leadership, and social justice.
