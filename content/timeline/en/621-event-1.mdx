**Event Details:**
Narrated by 'Ubadah bin As-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him), one of the leaders on the night of Al-Aqabah: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said while a group of his companions were around him,
> "Swear allegiance to me that you will not associate anything with Allah, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill your children, nor fabricate falsehood which you devise between your hands and feet, nor disobey me in what is good. Whoever among you fulfills this, his reward will be with Allah. Whoever commits any of these and is punished in this world, that will be an expiation for him. Whoever commits any of these and Allah conceals it, then it is up to Allah; if He wills, He will forgive him, and if He wills, He will punish him."

**He ('Ubadah bin As-Samit)** said, "So we swore allegiance to him upon that."
