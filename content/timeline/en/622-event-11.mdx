**Details of the Event:**

Among the profound effects of the migration of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions to Medina was the **brotherhood** established between the Muhajirin (Emigrants) and the Ansar (Helpers) (may Allah be pleased with them). This bond was so strong that, in the early stages, they even inherited from each other.

Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said regarding the verse:
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">وَلِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مَوَالِيَ</span>
>
> "And for all, We have made inheritors..." (Quran 4:33)
>
He explained:
> "It means **inheritors**. And as for:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">وَالَّذِينَ عَاقَدَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ</span>
>
> 'And those with whom you have made a solemn covenant...' (Quran 4:33)
>
> He said: 'When the Muhajirin came to Medina, the Muhajir would inherit from the Ansari, to the exclusion of his blood relatives, due to the brotherhood that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had established between them. But when the verse:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">وَلِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مَوَالِيَ</span>
>
> 'And for all, We have made inheritors...' was revealed, it abrogated that inheritance.' Then he said regarding:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">وَالَّذِينَ عَاقَدَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ</span>
>
> 'And those with whom you have made a solemn covenant...'
>
> 'This refers only to mutual support, provision, and advice; the inheritance has been abolished, but a bequest can still be made to them.'"

Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said:
> "When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Medina, the Muhajirin came to him and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, we have not seen any people more generous with much, nor better in sharing from little, than the people among whom we have settled. They have spared us effort and included us in their comfort, so much so that we fear they will take all the reward!' The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">«لَا، مَا دَعَوْتُمُ اللَّهَ لَهُمْ، وَأَثْنَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ»</span>
>
> 'No, not as long as you supplicate to Allah for them and praise them.'"

Abdur-Rahman ibn Awf (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated:
> "When we came to Medina, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) established brotherhood between me and Sa'd ibn ar-Rabi'. Sa'd ibn ar-Rabi' said: 'I am the wealthiest of the Ansar, so I will divide half of my wealth for you. And look at whichever of my two wives you desire, and I will divorce her for you, so when her waiting period ends, you may marry her.' Abdur-Rahman replied to him: 'I have no need for that. Is there a market where there is trade?' Sa'd said: 'The market of Banu Qaynuqa'.' Abdur-Rahman said: 'So Abdur-Rahman went to it early in the morning, and he came back with dried yogurt and clarified butter.' Abdur-Rahman continued: 'Then he continued going early, and it was not long before Abdur-Rahman came with traces of yellowish perfume on him.' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">«تَزَوَّجْتَ؟»</span>
>
> 'Have you married?'
>
> He said: 'Yes.' He asked:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">«وَمَنْ؟»</span>
>
> 'And whom?'
>
> He said: 'A woman from the Ansar.' He asked:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">«كَمْ سُقْتَ؟»</span>
>
> 'How much dowry did you give?'
>
> He said: 'The weight of a date-stone in gold – or a date-stone of gold.' Then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">«أَوْلِمْ وَلَوْ بِشَاةٍ»</span>
>
> 'Hold a wedding feast, even if it is with a single sheep.'"
