**Details of the Event:**

The Battle of **al-Abwaa’** (also known as the Battle of **Waddan**) marks a significant milestone as the <u>first military campaign</u> in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ personally participated. 

Key details of the campaign include:
* **Timing:** It took place in **Safar, 2 AH**, twelve months after the Prophet's ﷺ arrival in Medina.
* **Geography:** Al-Abwaa’ is a village located approximately **23 miles** from Medina. It was historically associated with pandemics (waba’), which is one reason cited for its name.
* **Objective:** The Prophet ﷺ set out with a group of Muhajirin to encounter a caravan of the **Quraysh**.
* **Diplomacy:** During this expedition, the Prophet ﷺ entered into a non-aggression pact (peace treaty) with **Bani Dumrah** ibn Bakr. The treaty was signed with their leader, **Makhshi ibn ‘Amr al-Dumri**.

> "This was a mission of peace and strategic positioning; the Prophet ﷺ returned to Medina without any actual combat breaking out."

During his absence, the Prophet ﷺ appointed **Sa’d ibn ‘Ubadah** (may Allah be pleased with him) to be in charge of Medina. Some historical reports also link the first arrow shot by **Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas** to this specific timeframe, though it is often categorized under the earlier expedition of 'Ubaydah ibn al-Harith.
