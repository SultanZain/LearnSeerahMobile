## Reasons for the Migration to Abyssinia

Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated:
> "When Mecca became unbearable for us, and the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) were persecuted and put to trial, and they saw the affliction and tribulation that befell them in their religion, and that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) could not repel it from them, while the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was protected by his people and his uncle, nothing he disliked of what befell his companions could reach him."

In these difficult circumstances, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) advised them to migrate:
> The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said to them: **"Indeed, there is a king in the land of Abyssinia with whom no one is wronged. So, go to his land until Allah grants you relief and an escape from your present state."**

## The Journey and Arrival of the Migrants

Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) continued:
> "So we departed for it until we gathered there. We settled in the best of homes with the best of neighbors. **We were safe in our religion and feared no injustice from him.**"

It is said that their departure for Abyssinia took place in **Rajab, in the fifth year of the Prophetic mission.**

**Twelve men and four women** from the Muslims migrated in this exodus. Among them was **Uthman ibn Affan**, who was the first to leave, accompanied by his wife, **Ruqayyah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).**
