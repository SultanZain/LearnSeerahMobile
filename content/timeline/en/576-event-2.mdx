Upon the passing of the Messenger of Allah’s ﷺ noble mother, **Aaminah bint Wahb**, when he was **six years of age**, the responsibility of his care was entrusted to his esteemed grandfather, **Abdul-Mutallib ibn Haashim**.

**Abdul-Mutallib** was a man of great nobility and honor within his community. The Quraysh held him in such high regard that they bestowed upon him the honorable epithet **“al-Fadl”**, recognizing his profound forgiveness and grace. Following the demise of his father, **Haashim ibn Abd Manaaf**, he was appointed to the significant duty of providing sustenance and protection to the pilgrims who journeyed to Makkah.

A deep and abiding love resided in **Abdul-Mutallib’s** heart for his grandson, Muhammad ﷺ, a love that surpassed even the affection he held for his own children. His compassion and tenderness towards him were more pronounced than towards his own sons.

**Ibn Ishaaq** eloquently narrated:

> “The Messenger of Allah ﷺ resided with his grandfather, Abdul-Mutallib ibn Haashim, after the death of his mother, Aaminah bint Wahb. A special mattress would be placed for Abdul-Mutallib in the shade of the Ka’bah. His sons would respectfully sit around it, awaiting his presence. Such was their reverence for him that none dared to sit upon it in his absence. The young Messenger of Allah ﷺ, then a healthy and robust boy, would approach and sit upon his grandfather’s mattress. His uncles would attempt to gently pull at the ends of his turban, trying to dissuade him. However, if Abdul-Mutallib witnessed this, he would interject, saying: **“Leave my son, for by Allah, he has a great matter in his future.”** He would then allow the young Muhammad ﷺ to sit beside him on the mattress, stroking his back with affection and finding pleasure in all that he did.”

**Abdul-Mutallib’s** care extended to the simplest of acts, for he would never partake in a meal without first uttering: **“My son!”** and ensuring that the young Muhammad ﷺ was also given to eat. When the shadow of death began to loom, **Abdul-Mutallib** offered his profound counsel to **Aboo Taalib**, entrusting him with the crucial responsibility of safeguarding and protecting the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.
