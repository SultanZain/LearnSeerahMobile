I said: 'O servant of Allah, will you sell this bell?' He said: 'What will you do with it?' I replied: 'We will call to prayer with it.' He said: 'Shall I not tell you of something better than that?' I said to him: 'Yes!' He then said: 'You should say:

> When I awoke, I came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and informed him of what I had seen. He said: 'Indeed, it is a true dream, if Allah wills. Stand with Bilal and convey to him what you have seen, and let him call the Adhan with it, for he has a louder voice than you.' So I stood with Bilal, and I began to convey it to him, and he would call the Adhan with it. Abdullah ibn Zayd said: Umar ibn al-Khattab heard that while he was in his house, so he came out dragging his garment, saying: 'By the One who sent you with the truth, O Messenger of Allah, I have seen exactly what he saw!' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'All praise is due to Allah!'"
