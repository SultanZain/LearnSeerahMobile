## Continuous Preaching and Increasing Persecution

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ **called to Allah Almighty in all his states**: night and day, secretly and openly. Nothing deterred him, no one turned him away, and no one hindered him. He would follow people in their gatherings, assemblies, and forums, during seasons, and at the stations of Hajj, **inviting everyone he met, whether free or slave, weak or strong, rich or poor.**

In contrast, the disbelievers from his people, the polytheists of Quraysh, began to oppress him and his followers. Indeed, among the most severe against him were his uncle **Abu Lahab** and his wife, **Umm Jamil, the carrier of firewood** (Arwa bint Harb ibn Umayya, sister of Abu Sufyan).

## Abu Talib's Protection and Quraysh's Demand

The Prophet's uncle, **Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib**, was affectionate towards him, treated him kindly, defended him, and protected him, even defying his own people in doing so, despite being upon their religion.

> His continuation upon the religion of his people was part of Allah's wisdom and a means of protection for His Messenger. Had Abu Talib embraced Islam, he would have lost his standing and influence among the polytheists of Quraysh, and they would no longer have feared or respected him.

Biographers narrated that Quraysh came to Abu Talib and said:
> **"Indeed, your nephew has annoyed us in our assembly and our mosque, so restrain him from us."**

Abu Talib then said: **"O Aqeel, go and bring Muhammad to me."**

## The Messenger's Reply and Abu Talib's Steadfastness

Aqeel brought him at midday, during the intense heat. When he arrived, Abu Talib said:
> "These cousins of yours claim that you are annoying them in their assembly and their mosque; so stop annoying them."

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ then looked up to the sky and said:
> **"Do you see this sun?"**
> They replied: "Yes."
> He said: **"I am no more able to abandon that (my mission) than you are able to light a torch from it (the sun)."**

Upon hearing this, Abu Talib said: **"By Allah, my nephew has never lied, so go back."**
