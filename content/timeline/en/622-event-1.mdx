**Details of the Event:**
Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated:
>“The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stayed in Mecca for ten years, following the people in their dwellings in Ukaz and Majannah, and during the seasons in Mina, saying: **‘Who will shelter me? Who will support me so that I may convey the message of my Lord, and for him will be Paradise?’** Until a man would come from Yemen or from Mudar, and his people would come to him and say: **‘Beware of the youth of Quraish, lest he mislead you.’** And he would walk among their men, and they would point at him with their fingers, until Allah sent us to him from Yathrib. We sheltered him and believed in him. Then a man from us would go out and believe in him and teach him the Quran, then he would return to his family and they would embrace Islam because of his Islam, until there was no house among the dwellings of the Ansar but that there was a group of Muslims in it who openly declared Islam. Then they all consulted together and said: ‘Until when shall we leave the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to be driven away in the mountains of Mecca, fearing?’ So seventy men of us journeyed to him until they came to him during the season, and we made an appointment with him at Shi'b al-Aqabah. We gathered with him, one or two men at a time, until we were all present, and we said: **‘O Messenger of Allah, we pledge allegiance to you.’** He said: **‘You pledge allegiance to me to listen and obey in times of enthusiasm and disinclination, and to spend in times of hardship and ease, and to enjoin good and forbid evil, and to speak for the sake of Allah, fearing no blame from anyone for the sake of Allah, and to support me and protect me if I come to you from that which you protect your own selves, your wives, and your children, and for you will be Paradise.’** He said: So we stood up to him and pledged allegiance to him. And As'ad ibn Zurarah, who was the youngest of them, took his hand and said: **‘Wait, O people of Yathrib! We have not struck the livers of camels except that we know that he is the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and that expelling him today means the alienation of all the Arabs, and the killing of your best men, and that the swords will bite you. So either you are a people who can endure that, and your reward will be with Allah, or you are a people who fear for yourselves a calamity, so make that clear, for that will be an excuse for you before Allah.’** They said: **‘Leave us alone, O As'ad! By Allah, we will never forsake this pledge, and we will never withdraw from it.’** He said: So we stood up to him and pledged allegiance to him, and he took our pledge and stipulated conditions for us, and for that he promised us Paradise.”
