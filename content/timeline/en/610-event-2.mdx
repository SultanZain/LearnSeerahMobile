**Details of the Event:**

The revelation ceased coming to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for a period of time, which greatly distressed and saddened him. Then, Jibreel came to him with Surah Ad-Duha, in which his Lord—the One Who had honored him with what He had honored him—swore that He had not forsaken him.

Al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih, from the hadith of Jundub ibn Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said:

> “Jibreel (peace be upon him) was delayed in coming to the Prophet ﷺ, so a woman from Quraysh—who was Umm Jamil Arwa bint Harb, the sister of Abu Sufyan and the wife of Abu Lahab—said: ‘His devil has forsaken him.’ Then Allah revealed:

> *'By the forenoon (after sun-rise); And by the night when it is still (and dark). Your Lord (O Muhammad ﷺ) has neither forsaken you nor hated you.'*" (Ad-Duha 93:1-3)
