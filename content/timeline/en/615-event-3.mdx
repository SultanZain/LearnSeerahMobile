## Return and Second Migration

The migrants in Abyssinia heard that **Quraysh had embraced Islam**, so they returned to Mecca in **Shawwal of the same year they had migrated**.

> However, when they were a short distance from Mecca and realized the true situation, some of them returned to Abyssinia, and none of the others entered Mecca except secretly or under the protection of a Quraysh man.

Then, the affliction and torment from Quraysh intensified upon them and upon the Muslims, and their tribes oppressed them severely. It was difficult for Quraysh to bear the news of the Negus's good treatment. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saw no alternative but to advise his companions to migrate to Abyssinia **a second time**.

The Muslims prepared for the migration again. Quraysh attempted to thwart the second migration, but the Muslims were swifter, reaching the Negus of Abyssinia before they could be overtaken.

**Eighty-three men and eighteen or nineteen women** migrated.

## Quraysh's Delegation to the Negus

Quraysh sent **Amr ibn al-Aas and Abdullah ibn Abi Rabee'ah** before they embraced Islam, and they sent with them **rare gifts** for the Negus and his patriarchs. After they arrived before the Negus, they presented him with the gifts, then spoke to him, saying:
> **"O King, indeed some foolish youths have sought refuge in your land. They have abandoned the religion of their people and have not entered your religion. They have come with a religion they invented, which neither we nor you know. The nobles of their people, their fathers, uncles, and tribes, have sent us to you concerning them, so that you may return them to them, for they know them better and are more aware of what they have criticized them for."**

They admonished them in his presence, and the patriarchs said: **"They have spoken truly, O King, so hand them over to them, that they may return them to their people and their lands."**

## The Negus's Dialogue with the Muslims

The Negus then sent for the Muslims and invited them. They came, having resolved to **speak nothing but the truth, whatever the consequences.**

The Negus asked them:
> **"What is this religion in which you have separated from your people, and which you have not entered my religion or any of these religions?"**

**Ja'far ibn Abi Talib** (who was the spokesman for the Muslims) replied:
> "O King, we were a people of ignorance; we used to worship idols, eat carrion, commit indecencies, break ties of kinship, treat our neighbors badly, and the strong among us would devour the weak."
>
> He then enumerated the good things that the Prophet (peace be upon him) brought them, and continued: "So we believed him, and had faith in him, and followed him in what he brought us from the religion of Allah. We worshipped Allah alone, associating nothing with Him, and we forbade what was forbidden to us, and permitted what was permitted to us. Then our people rose against us, torturing us and trying to turn us away from our religion, to make us return to the worship of idols instead of worshipping Allah Almighty, and to permit the abominations we used to permit. When they oppressed us, wronged us, made life difficult for us, and came between us and our religion, we came out to your land, choosing you over anyone else, desiring your protection, and hoping that we would not be wronged in your presence, O King."

The Negus asked him: **"Do you have anything with you from what he (Muhammad) brought from Allah?"**
Ja'far replied: **"Yes."**

The Negus said: **"Then recite it to me."**
So he recited to him the beginning of **(Surah Maryam)**.
> The Negus wept until his beard was wet, and his bishops wept until their scriptures were wet when they heard what was recited to them.

## The Negus's Decision and Support for the Muslims

Then the Negus said to them:
> **"Indeed, this and what Jesus brought come from the same source. Go, for by Allah, I will not hand them over to you both, nor shall they be harmed"** (addressing Amr ibn al-Aas and his companion).

So they departed. When they left, Amr ibn al-Aas said to Abdullah ibn Abi Rabee'ah:
> **"By Allah, tomorrow I will come to him with something about them that will utterly destroy their flourishing."**

Abdullah ibn Abi Rabee'ah said to him: **"Do not do it, for they have kinship, even if they have differed with us."**
But Amr persisted in his opinion.

The next day, he said to the Negus: **"O King, they say a great thing about Jesus, son of Mary."**

So the Negus sent for them, asking them about their statement concerning the Messiah. They were alarmed, but resolved to speak nothing but the truth, whatever the consequences. When they entered before him and he asked them, Ja'far said to him:
> **"We say concerning him what our Prophet (peace be upon him) brought us: He is the servant of Allah and His Messenger, and His spirit and His word which He cast to Mary the Virgin and the pure."**

The Negus took a stick from the ground and then said:
> **"By Allah, Jesus, son of Mary, did not exceed what you said by this stick."**

His patriarchs grumbled, so he said: **"Even if you grumble!"**
Then he said to the Muslims:
> **"Go, for you are safe in my land – and 'Shuyoom' means 'safe ones' in the Abyssinian language – whoever insults you will be fined, whoever insults you will be fined, whoever insults you will be fined. I would not wish to have a mountain of gold, and yet harm one of you – and 'dabr' means 'mountain' in the Abyssinian language –."**

Then he said to his entourage:
> **"Return their gifts to them, for I have no need of them. By Allah, Allah did not take a bribe from me when He restored my kingdom to me, so I shall not take a bribe concerning it. And the people did not obey me in my matters, so I shall not obey them in this."**

Umm Salamah said:
> **"So they left his presence disgraced, with what they had brought returned to them, and we remained with him in the best of homes with the best of neighbors."**
