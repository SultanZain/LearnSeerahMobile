**Details of the Event:**

In the month of Ramadan, 1 AH, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) dispatched an expedition to the seashore (Sif al-Bahr) under the command of **Hamzah ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib** (may Allah be pleased with him). The group consisted of thirty riders, all of whom were **Muhajirin** (Emigrants). 

This event is historically significant as the Prophet ﷺ handed Hamzah a white banner, which is considered the **first banner** ever assigned to a Muslim commander in Islam; it was carried by Abu Mirthad, Kannaz ibn Hussayn al-Ghanawee. The objective was to intercept a trade caravan of the Quraysh returning from Ash-Sham, led by Abu Jahl with 300 riders. The two parties met at the coast near al-‘Is and lined up for battle. However, **Majdi ibn ‘Amr al-Juhani**, who had friendly ties with both sides, intervened and mediated between them. Due to his efforts, the two groups separated without actual combat. This expedition occurred around the same time as the expedition of ‘Ubaydah ibn al-Harith to Rabigh.
