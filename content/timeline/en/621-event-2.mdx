**Details of the Event:**
In this great event, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw the Prophets, and he saw Sidrat al-Muntaha (the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary) and other great signs. In it, the five daily prayers were made obligatory, and this is something that the narrations in the two Sahihs (al-Bukhari and Muslim) agree upon. The Quraish denied the occurrence of the Isra and Mi'raj, and this is also something that the narrations in the two Sahihs agree upon.

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
>“I saw myself in the Hijr, and the Quraish were asking me about my Night Journey. They asked me about things in Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) which I had not paid attention to, and I felt such distress as I had never felt before.”

He said:
>“Then Allah raised it (Bayt al-Maqdis) before me, and I looked at it, and whatever they asked me about, I told them. And I saw myself among a group of Prophets. Musa (Moses) was standing and praying, and he was a lean man with wavy hair, as if he was from the men of Shanu’ah. And ‘Isa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), peace be upon him, was standing and praying, and the person who resembled him most was ‘Urwah bin Mas’ud al-Thaqafi. And Ibrahim (Abraham), peace be upon him, was standing and praying, and the person who resembled him most was your companion (meaning himself). Then the time for prayer came, and I led them in prayer. When I finished the prayer, a voice said:

>‘O Muhammad, this is Malik, the keeper of Hell, so greet him.’ I turned to him, and he greeted me first.”
