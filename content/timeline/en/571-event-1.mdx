## The Blessed Arrival

The scholars of biography and history hold differing views on the precise date of the Prophet's ﷺ birth. However, they are in unanimous agreement that he was born on a **Monday** during the **Year of the Elephant**.

Ibn al-Qayyim stated definitively, "There is no difference of opinion on the fact that he was born in the middle of Makkah and that it was during the Year of the Elephant."

Furthermore, on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be well pleased with him and his father), it is narrated: "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was born during the Year of the Elephant." This is a well-established fact upon which the scholars hold consensus, as reported by Khaleefah ibn Khayyaat, Ibn al-Jazzaar, Ibn Dihiyyah, and Ibn al-Jawzee.

Regarding his birth on a Monday, it has been narrated on the authority of Abee Qataadah al-Ansaaree (may Allah be well pleased with him) that the Prophet ﷺ was asked about fasting on Mondays, to which he responded:
> **"That is the day on which I was born, the day on which I was sent on my mission as a Messenger - or the first day on which I received revelation."**

Ibn Katheer emphatically stated:
>"Those who claim that he was born on a Friday, the 17th of Rabee’ al-Awwaal, have greatly erred."

Al-Tabari confirms that Muhammad was born in the Year of Elephant: 
> The birth of the Messenger of God took place during the reign of Kisra Anusharwan in the year when Abrahah al-Ashram Abu Yaksum marched against Mecca with the Abyssinians, bringing with him the elephant, having the intention of demolishing the House of God.
## Testimonies and Circumstances

While the exact month and day of his birth remain a point of scholarly discussion, Ibn Ishaaq narrated, based on the accounts of several Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), that they asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about himself. He ﷺ replied: **"I am the prayer of my father [Prophet] Ibraaheem, and the glad tidings from Jesus. When my mother gave birth to me, she saw there was light protruding from her which illuminated the palaces of Al-Shaam."** Al-Albaanee graded the chain of narrators for this report as "very good and strong."

The birth of the Prophet ﷺ occurred after the passing of his father, Abdullah, while he was still in the womb of his mother. Thus, the Prophet ﷺ grew up as an orphan. Moreover, his birth took place in the house of Abee Taalib, situated in the district of Banee Haashim.
