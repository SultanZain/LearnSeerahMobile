**Details of the Event:**

Thirteen months after the Hijrah, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ led an expedition known as the **First Battle of Badr** (or the Expedition of Safwan). 

The primary cause and details of this mission are as follows:
* **The Provocation:** A man named **Kurz ibn Jabir al-Fihri** led a raid on the outskirts of Medina, successfully stealing camels and livestock belonging to the Muslims.
* **The Pursuit:** In response, the Prophet ﷺ set out personally to capture him. He appointed **Zayd ibn Harithah** (may Allah be pleased with him) to remain in charge of Medina.
* **The Banner:** The white banner of this mission was carried by **Ali ibn Abi Talib** (may Allah be pleased with him).

The Prophet ﷺ and his companions pursued Kurz until they reached a valley called **Safwan**, located in the vicinity of Badr. 

> "Despite the swift pursuit, Kurz ibn Jabir managed to escape before the Muslim forces could intercept him. Consequently, no combat took place, and the Prophet ﷺ returned to Medina."

This expedition is distinct from the "Great Battle of Badr" that occurred later; it served as a clear message that the <u>security of Medina's resources</u> would be strictly defended.
