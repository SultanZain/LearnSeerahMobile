## The Suffering of the Companions at the Hands of the Quraysh

The first seven to openly declare their Islam were: the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), Abu Bakr, 'Ammar, his mother Sumayya, Suhayb, Bilal, and al-Miqdad.

> As for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), Allah protected him through **his uncle Abu Talib**, and Abu Bakr was protected by **his tribe**.

The rest of them were seized by the polytheists, who **made them wear iron armor and exposed them to the scorching sun**. None of them but Bilal resisted their demands and only feigned agreement.

### The Steadfastness of Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him)

> Bilal, however, held his life cheap for the sake of Allah, and his people held him in contempt. So they seized him and gave him to children, who would drag him around the valleys of Mecca while he exclaimed: **"ONE, ONE (Allah is One)!"**

They placed a rope around his neck and handed him over to boys who would play with him, until it left marks on his neck. Bilal belonged to some of the Banu Jumah, and the one who took the greatest part in torturing him was **Umayya ibn Khalaf**.

> He would bring Bilal out when the heat of the midday sun was intense, throw him on his back in the open ground of Mecca, and then order a huge rock to be placed on his chest. He would then say to him: **"You will remain like this until you die or renounce Muhammad and worship al-Lat and al-'Uzza."**

But in the midst of this torment and suffering, Bilal would say: **"ONE, ONE!"** It was as if his suffering and trials only increased his faith.

### The Emancipation of Bilal and Others

Abu Bakr felt compassion for him when he saw him one day in this severe humiliation, so he bought him and set him free, and also freed **six others who were being tortured for their Islam**.
