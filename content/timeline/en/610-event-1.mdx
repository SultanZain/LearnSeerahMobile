**Details of the Event:**

The first form of revelation that began for the Prophet ﷺ was true dreams in his sleep. He would never see a dream but it would come to pass just like the brightness of the morning. Then, seclusion became beloved to him ﷺ, so he would seclude himself in the Cave of Hira' and engage in *tahannuth* (devotion) therein, until Jibreel (peace be upon him) came to him while he was in the cave with the words of Allah تعالى:

> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl"> اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ <span>١</span> خَلَقَ الْإِنْسَانَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ <span>٢</span> اقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ الْأَكْرَمُ <span>٣</span> الَّذِي عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ <span>٤</span> عَلَّمَ الْإِنْسَانَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ <span>٥</span> </span>

> *"Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists), has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood). Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous, Who has taught (the writing) by the pen, has taught man that which he knew not."* (Al-Alaq 96:1-5)

He ﷺ recounted this to his wife Khadijah, who then narrated what had happened to Waraqah ibn Nawfal, and he confirmed it, saying: **“This is the same Angel who came to Musa.”** Then the revelation ceased for a period of time. After that, Jibreel came to him again while he was sitting on a chair, so the Prophet ﷺ was afraid of him and returned to his family saying: **“Cover me! Cover me!”** Then Allah تعالى revealed:

> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl"> يَاأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ <span>١</span> قُمْ فَأَنْذِرْ <span>٢</span> وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ <span>٣</span> وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ <span>٤</span> وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ <span>٥</span> </span>
>
> *"O you (Muhammad ﷺ) enveloped in garments! Arise and warn! And your Lord (Allâh) magnify! And your garments purify! And keep away from Ar-Rujz (the idols)!"* (Al-Muddaththir 74:1-5)

This was the beginning of his prophethood and the commencement of the command to convey the message.
