## The First Encounter at Al-Aqabah

When Allah Almighty willed to make His religion manifest, to honor His Prophet ﷺ, and to fulfill His promise to him, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ went out during the Hajj season, presenting himself to the Arab tribes, as he used to do every season.

While he was at **Al-Aqabah**, he met a group of **Khazraj** whom Allah intended good for. He asked them: **"Who are you?"** They replied: **"A group from the Khazraj."** He asked: **"Are you allies of the Jews?"** They said: **"Yes."** He asked: **"Will you not sit down so I may speak to you?"** They said: **"Yes."**

So they sat with him, and he invited them to Allah Almighty, presented Islam to them, and recited the Quran to them.

## The Khazraj's Recognition of the Prophet's ﷺ Prophethood

Among what Allah had done for them regarding Islam was that the Jews were with them in their land, and they used to threaten them with the imminent appearance of a prophet whom they would follow and then kill the Arabs with him, as Iram was killed.

So when the Prophet ﷺ spoke to them and invited them to Allah, some of them said to each other: **"O people, by Allah, know that he is indeed the Prophet whom the Jews threatened you with, so do not let them precede you to him."**

They responded to his invitation and said to him: **"Indeed, we have left our people, and no people are entangled in enmity and evil as they are. Perhaps Allah will unite them through you. So we will go forth and invite them to your cause, and present to them this religion which we have accepted from you. If Allah unites them upon you, then there will be no man more honored than you."**

Then they departed, returning to their land, having believed and affirmed.

## The Spread of Islam in Medina

When they arrived in Medina among their people, they mentioned the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to them and invited them to Islam, until **it spread among them, and there was no house among the Ansar's houses except that it contained mention of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ**.
