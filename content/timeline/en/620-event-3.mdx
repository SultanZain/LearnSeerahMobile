## The Jinn Listen to the Quran

When the Prophet ﷺ returned to Mecca from Ta'if, and was in **Nakhlah**, he stood in the middle of the night to pray. A group of Jinn, whom Allah Almighty mentioned, passed by him. They were **seven individuals from the Jinn of Nasibin**.

They listened to the Messenger's ﷺ recitation. When he finished his prayer, they returned to their people as warners, having believed and responded to what they heard.

Regarding them, Allah Almighty revealed:
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl"> وَإِذْ صَرَفْنَا إِلَيْكَ نَفَرًا مِّنَ الْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقُرْآنَ فَلَمَّا حَضَرُوهُ قَالُوا أَنصِتُوا فَلَمَّا قُضِيَ وَلَّوْا إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ <span>٢٩</span> قَالُوا يَا قَوْمَنَا إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا كِتَابًا أُنزِلَ مِن بَعْدِ مُوسَىٰ مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ يَهْدِي إِلَى الْحَقِّ وَإِلَىٰ طَرِيقٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ <span>٣٠</span> يَا قَوْمَنَا أَجِيبُوا دَاعِيَ اللَّهِ وَآمِنُوا بِهِ يَغْفِرْ لَكُم مِّن ذُنُوبِكُمْ وَيُجِرْكُم مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ <span>٣١</span> وَمَن لَّا يُجِبْ دَاعِيَ اللَّهِ فَلَيْسَ بِمُعْجِزٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَيْسَ لَهُ مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءُ أُولَٰئِكَ فِي ضَلَالٍ مُّبِينٍ <span>٣٢</span></span>

> **Translation of Surah Al-Ahqaf (46), verses 29-32:**
>
> (29) And [mention, O Muhammad], when We directed to you a group of the jinn, listening to the Quran; and when they attended it, they said, 'Listen quietly.' And when it was concluded, they went back to their people as warners.
>
> (30) They said, 'O our people, indeed we have heard a Book revealed after Moses, confirming what was before it, guiding to the truth and to a straight path.
>
> (31) O our people, respond to the caller of Allah and believe in him; He will forgive for you your sins and protect you from a painful punishment.'
>
> (32) But whoever does not respond to the caller of Allah - he will not cause failure [to Allah] upon earth, and he will not have besides Him any protectors. Those are in clear error.

## The Second Delegation of Jinn

Several months after the first delegation of Jinn met the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, a second delegation arrived, eager to see the Beloved Chosen One ﷺ and to listen to the words of the Lord of the Worlds.
