As the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reached the tender age of **six**, a significant journey commenced. His noble mother, **Aaminah bint Wahb**, embarked with him to visit his maternal uncles from the esteemed **Banee ‘Addee ibn al-Najjaar**. Accompanying them was his devoted wet nurse, **Umm Ayman** (may Allah be well pleased with her), and they traveled upon two separate she-camels.

Their initial destination within the territory of the tribe of **al-Naabighah** held a poignant significance, for it was near the very ground where his beloved father, **Abdullah ibn ‘Abd’ul-Muttalib**, lay at rest.

They remained in the company of his maternal uncles for a full month. As their return journey to Makkah unfolded, a sorrowful event transpired: the passing of his mother ﷺ. It was **Umm Ayman**, whose given name was **Barakah bint Tha’labah ibn Hisn**, who shouldered the responsibility of completing the journey back to Makkah with the young Prophet ﷺ.

**Umm Ayman** held an immense affection for the Prophet ﷺ and dedicated herself to his meticulous care, enveloping him in her love and protection. In return, the Prophet ﷺ reciprocated with profound loyalty, reverence, and exceptional graciousness. In the fullness of time, the Prophet ﷺ honored her by setting her free. Subsequently, she married **Zayd ibn Haarithah** (may Allah be well pleased with him), and their union was blessed with the birth of **Usaamah ibn Zayd** (may Allah be well pleased with them both).

The life of **Umm Ayman** (may Allah be well pleased with her) drew to a close a mere five months after the passing of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.
