## The Islam of Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib (may Allah be pleased with him)

Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib (may Allah be pleased with him) embraced Islam in **late sixth year of Prophethood**.

### Reason for His Islam: Noble Indignation

The cause of his conversion was a painful incident that befell the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.
> One day, Abu Jahl passed by the Messenger of Allah ﷺ at Safa, **abusing him and slandering him**. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ remained silent, not speaking to him. Then, **Abu Jahl struck him with a stone on his head, splitting it open until blood flowed from it**. Abu Jahl then left and went to the Quraysh assembly near the Kaaba and sat with them.

A freed slave woman of Abdullah ibn Jud'an, who lived in a dwelling on Safa, witnessed this. Hamza returned from hunting, carrying his bow over his shoulder, and the freed woman informed him of what she had seen Abu Jahl do.

> Hamza became enraged and rushed out, not stopping for anyone, intent on confronting Abu Jahl upon meeting him. When he entered the Mosque, he stood over Abu Jahl and said to him: **"You insult my nephew while I am upon his religion!"** Then he **struck him with his bow, inflicting a severe wound.**

Men from Banu Makhzum (Abu Jahl's tribe) rose up, and men from Banu Hashim (Hamza's tribe) also rose. Abu Jahl then said:
> **"Leave Abu Umarah alone! Indeed, I insulted his nephew in a vile manner."**

### Certainty of the Heart: From Indignation to Faith

Ibn Ishaq reported:
> "Then Hamza returned home, and Satan came to him and said: You are the chief of Quraysh, yet you have followed this Sabi' (renegade), and abandoned the religion of your forefathers. Death is better for you than what you have done. Hamza then reflected and said to himself: **"What have I done?! O Allah, if it is guidance, then make its affirmation firm in my heart, and if not, then grant me a way out from what I have fallen into."**"

He spent a night unlike any other due to Satan's whisperings. When morning came, he went to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said:
> "O son of my brother, I have fallen into a matter and I do not know how to get out of it. For someone like me to remain upon something I do not know whether it is guidance or severe error, is unacceptable. So, tell me a narrative; for I long, O son of my brother, for you to speak to me."

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ then **reminded him, advised him, warned him, and gave him glad tidings**, and Allah cast faith into his heart regarding what the Messenger of Allah ﷺ had said.

> Hamza then declared: **"I bear witness that you are the truthful one, with a truthful testimony. So, proclaim your religion, O son of my brother, for by Allah, I would not wish to have all that the sky covers, and yet remain upon my former religion."**

Thus, Hamza's Islam (may Allah be pleased with him) was initially out of **a man's indignation who refused to see his protected one humiliated**, but then Allah expanded his chest, and he held fast to the firmest handhold. **The Muslims found immense strength through him!**
