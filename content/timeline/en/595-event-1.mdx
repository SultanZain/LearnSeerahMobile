**Details of the Event:**

There are varying narrations regarding the age of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her) at the time of their marriage. It is said that the Prophet ﷺ was twenty-five, twenty-seven, or thirty years old, among other accounts. Similarly, there are differing reports about the age of Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her), ranging from thirty-five to forty years old and other narrations.

When Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her) heard about the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, his trustworthiness, and his noble character, the following incident is narrated:

> Khadijah's sister had hired the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and his partner for a business venture. When they completed their journey, her sister still owed them something. The partner would come to them to claim it and would say to Muhammad ﷺ: **“Go!”** But he ﷺ would reply: **“You go, for I feel shy.”** Once, when his partner came, she asked: **“Where is Muhammad? Why doesn't he come with you?”** He replied: **“I told him to, but he claimed that he feels shy.”** She mentioned this to her sister Khadijah, who said: **“I have never seen a man more modest, more chaste, or more... than Muhammad ﷺ.”**

This incident impressed Khadijah's sister, so she sent a message to the Prophet ﷺ saying: **“Go to my father and propose marriage to him.”** The Prophet ﷺ replied: **“Your father is a wealthy man, and he might not agree.”** She said: **“Go and meet him and speak to him, and I will take care of the rest.”**

The Prophet ﷺ married Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her) while she was a widow.
