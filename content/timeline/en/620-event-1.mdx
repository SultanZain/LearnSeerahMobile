## The Best of Women and Her Status

She is **Khadijah bint Khuwaylid ibn Asad ibn Abd al-Uzza ibn Qusayy ibn Kilab**, from the best women in the world.

Jibreel (Gabriel) came to the Prophet ﷺ and said:
> "O Messenger of Allah, this is Khadijah. She has come to you with a vessel containing a relish – or food or drink – so when she comes to you, **convey to her greetings from her Lord and from me, and give her the glad tidings of a house in Paradise made of reeds, wherein there will be no noise or toil**."

Khadijah was the first to embrace Islam through the Prophet ﷺ.
* **She believed in him when people disbelieved.**
* **She sheltered him when people rejected him.**
* **She affirmed him when people denied him.**

Allah blessed him with children through her:
* **Al-Qasim, At-Tayyib, and At-Tahir** (who died in infancy).
* **Ruqayyah, Zaynab, Umm Kulthum, and Fatimah**.

## The Year of Sorrow and Her Demise

She (may Allah be pleased with her) passed away in **the same year as Abu Talib**, so calamities followed one after another for the Messenger of Allah ﷺ with their deaths.

> Khadijah was a **sincere helper for Islam**, and the Prophet ﷺ found comfort in her.

"Khadijah passed away three years before the Prophet's ﷺ departure to Medina. He stayed for two years or close to that, and then married Aisha when she was six years old, and then consummated the marriage with her when she was nine years old."

Umm al-Mu'minin Khadijah bint Khuwaylid (may Allah be pleased with her) passed away in **Mecca** and was buried in **Al-Hajun**.
