The Oath of the Righteous took place in one of the four sacred months of the Arab calendar. The various tribes of Quraysh were united around it: Banoo Haashim, Banoo Al-Muttalib, Asad ibn ‘Abd’ul-‘Uzzah ibn Kilaab, and Taym ibn Murrah. They gathered at the house of ‘Abdullah ibn Jud’aan al-Taymee because of his maturity and nobility. And so, they all swore and agreed that there would not be a single person ever oppressed in all of Makkah except that they would stand with them; and that they would fight against the oppressor until they returned what they had wrongfully taken.

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was present at this oath and he said regarding it: **“Verily I have witnessed in the house of Abdullah ibn Jud’aan, an oath that is more beloved to me than red she-camels. Were I to be called upon to fulfill that oath in Islam, I would not hesitate!”** The very spirit of this oath negates the fanaticism of the time of Jaahiliyyah in which was overtaken by the spirit of excessive zeal for one’s clan and tribe.

It has been said that the cause of this oath that a man from Banoo Zubayd arrived in Makkah with his goods for sale. Al-‘Aas ibn Waa’il al-Sahmee then purchased them from him, however, he did not pay him for them. He then appealed for assistance from his allies from amongst the Banoo Abd’l-Daar, Banoo Makhzoom, Banoo Jumah, Banoo Sahm, and the Banoo ‘Adee, but none of them did much to help him.

The man from the Banoo Zubayd then climbed a mountain and began calling out to people, and exclaiming, reciting poetry that described his plight. Hearing this, al-Zubayr ibn al-Muttalib agreed with it and and then said this man has no one to protect him.” Everyone gathered and agreed to the oath that came to be known as the Oath of the Righteous (Hilf al-Fudool). Then they all stood and went to al-‘Aas ibn Waa’il and took from him the right of the man from Zubayd.

The reason it came to be known as the Oath of the Righteous is because three men from the tribe of Jurhu: al-Fadl ibn Fadaalah, Fadl ibn Wadaa’ah, and Fadl ibn al-Haarith had all previously agreed to this sort of oath before. When the oath that was being agreed upon by Quraysh began to resemble the oath of those three men from Jurhum, it took of the name of The Oath of al-Fudool.
