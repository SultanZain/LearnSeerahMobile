On the authority of **Anas ibn Maalik** (may Allah be pleased with him), it is reported that:

> “Jibreel (peace be upon him) came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ while he was playing with the other little boys, and he put him on the ground and then proceeded to split open his chest near his heart. He then took out his heart and removed from it a small piece of flesh. Jibreel then said: **“This is what Satan would have used to get a hold of you (i.e., Allah removed from any possibility that he could ever be influenced by the devil in any way shape or form).”** Then he washed (the heart) in a small bowl made of gold and with Zamzam water. Then he placed the heart back, stitched him and placed him back where he was playing. The other boys had run back to their mother—who was his wet nurse—and said to her: **“Muhammad has been killed!”** When he came back to them, his face and skin were pale.”

**Anas** (may Allah be pleased with him) then said: **“I remember seeing the scars of the stitches on his chest.”**
