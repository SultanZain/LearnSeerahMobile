## The Severity of Illness and the Prophet's ﷺ Invitation

After the illness of **Abu Talib, the Prophet's ﷺ uncle**, became severe – he who had taken care of him as a child, supported him as an adult, aided him in his call, and protected him from the harms of the polytheists – the Prophet ﷺ entered upon him. Abu Jahl was also present. The Prophet ﷺ said:
> **"O my uncle, say: 'There is no god but Allah,' a word by which I will argue for you before Allah."**

Abu Jahl and Abdullah ibn Abi Umayyah then said: **"O Abu Talib, do you turn away from the religion of Abdul-Muttalib?"**
They did not cease speaking to him until the last thing he said to them was: **"Upon the religion of Abdul-Muttalib."**

>
> **Translation of Surah At-Tawbah (9), verse 113:**

> "It is not for the Prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of Hellfire."

And also revealed was:
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">﴿إِنَّكَ لَا تَهْدِي مَنْ أَحْبَبْتَ وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِي مَن يَشَاءُ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُهْتَدِينَ﴾</span>
>
> **Translation of Surah Al-Qasas (28), verse 56:**
>
> "Indeed, you do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided."

## Abu Talib: A Protector for the Prophet ﷺ

Abu Talib had been **the fortress that protected the Prophet ﷺ from the attacks of the dignitaries and the foolish**, but he remained upon the religion of his forefathers, and thus did not succeed.
