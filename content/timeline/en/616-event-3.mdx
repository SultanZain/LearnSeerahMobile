## Quraysh's Plot and the Protection of Banu Abd al-Muttalib

When Quraysh resolved to **kill the Messenger of Allah ﷺ**, Banu Abd al-Muttalib unanimously decided to take the Messenger of Allah ﷺ into their valley (Shi'b) and protect him there.

Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said the next day, on the Day of Sacrifice, while in Mina:
> **"We will descend tomorrow in the valley of Banu Kinanah; where they swore an oath against disbelief."** This refers to Al-Muhassab.

This was because **Quraysh and Kinanah** had formed an alliance against Banu Hashim and Banu Abd al-Muttalib, or Banu al-Muttalib:
> **"That they would not intermarry with them nor buy from them until they hand over the Prophet ﷺ to them."**

So, all of them entered the valley, both their Muslims and their disbelievers.

## The Economic and Social Boycott

The polytheists unanimously decided on:
* **Not sitting with them.**
* **Not mingling with them.**
* **Not trading with them.**
* **Not entering their houses.**

All of this was **until they surrender the Messenger of Allah for execution**. They wrote a **document (sahifah)** to that effect.

## The Severity of the Siege and the End of the Boycott

Banu Hashim remained in their valley for **three years**.
> **The affliction, hardship, and hunger intensified upon them.**

After three years, some men from Quraysh began to reproach each other for what had happened and unanimously decided to **nullify the document**. Thus, **the boycott ended**.
