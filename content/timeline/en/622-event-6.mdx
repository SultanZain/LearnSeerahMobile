**Details of the Event:**

After the Second Pledge of Aqabah was concluded, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded those with him to migrate to Medina. So, they began to leave in groups.

Among the first to migrate after the Second Pledge of Aqabah was Mus'ab ibn Umayr. Then came Amir ibn Rabi'ah, an ally of Banu Adi ibn Ka'b, along with his wife Layla bint Abi Hathmah ibn Ghanim. Following them was Abdullah ibn Jahsh with his family and his brother Abd ibn Jahsh (also known as Abu Ahmad), who was blind. Their residences, along with that of Abu Salamah, were in Quba, among Banu Amr ibn Awf.

When all of Banu Jahsh migrated with their women, Abu Sufyan seized their empty house in Mecca. When news of this reached Abdullah ibn Jahsh, he mentioned it to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him:

> "Are you not pleased, O Abdullah, that Allah will give you a house in Paradise better than it?"

Abdullah replied: "Yes!" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "Then that is for you." Later, when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) conquered Mecca, Abu Ahmad (Abdullah ibn Jahsh's brother) spoke to him about their house, but the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) hesitated to address it. The people then told Abu Ahmad: "O Abu Ahmad, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) dislikes that you should seek to reclaim anything you sacrificed for the sake of Allah." So, he refrained from speaking to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about it.

All of Banu Ghanim ibn Dudan were Muslims and had all migrated to Medina.

Then, Umar ibn al-Khattab and Ayyash ibn Abi Rabi'ah migrated with twenty riders and arrived in Medina. Hisham ibn al-As ibn Wa'il had also embraced Islam and promised Umar ibn al-Khattab that he would migrate with him. He said: "You will find me, or I will find you, at Ada'ah of Banu Ghifar." However, Hisham's people became aware of his intention and detained him, preventing his migration.

Then, Abu Jahl and Al-Harith ibn Hisham left Mecca and reached Medina while the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was still in Mecca. They spoke to Ayyash ibn Abi Rabi'ah, who was their maternal half-brother and cousin. They informed him that his mother had vowed not to wash her head or seek shade until she saw him. Ayyash felt pity for his mother and believed them, so he set out to return with them. On the way, they tied him up and brought him to Mecca in broad daylight, bound. Then they said: "O people of Mecca, do this with your foolish ones just as we have done with our foolish one!" They imprisoned him there until Allah rescued him later through the supplication of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the Qunut prayer:

> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">اللَّهُمَّ أَنْجِ الْوَلِيدَ بْنَ الْوَلِيدِ، وَسَلَمَةَ بْنَ هِشَامٍ، وَعَيَّاشَ بْنَ أَبِي رَبِيعَةَ.</span>

"O Allah, save Al-Walid ibn Al-Walid, Salamah ibn Hisham, and Ayyash ibn Abi Rabi'ah."

When Suhayb ibn Sinan intended to migrate, the disbelievers of Quraish said to him: "You came to us as a poor, lowly person, and your wealth grew with us, and you reached the position you reached. Now you want to leave with your wealth and yourself? No, by Allah, that will not happen!" Suhayb said to them: "What if I give you all my wealth, will you clear my way?" They said: "Yes." So he said: "Indeed, I have given it to you." When this news reached the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he said:

> "Suhayb has profited! Suhayb has profited!"

Then the Muhajireen continued to migrate to Medina until the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) himself migrated.
