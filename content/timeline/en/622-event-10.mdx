**Details of the Event:**

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) rode his she-camel from Quba, and people walked alongside him until it knelt down at the place of the Messenger's Mosque in Medina, where some Muslims were already praying. This site was a date drying ground (Mirbad) belonging to two orphan boys, Sahl and Suhayl, who were under the guardianship of As'ad ibn Zurarah.

When his she-camel knelt, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">«هَذَا إِنْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ الْمَنْزِلُ»</span>
>
> "This, if Allah wills, is the lodging place."

Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called the two boys and negotiated with them to buy the Mirbad to make it a mosque. They said: "No, rather we gift it to you, O Messenger of Allah!" But the Messenger of Allah refused to accept it as a gift until he bought it from them. Then he built it into a mosque.

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) began to carry bricks with them during its construction, and while carrying the bricks, he would say:
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">هَذَا الْحِمَالُ لَا حِمَالَ خَيْبَرْ، هَذَا أَبَرُّ رَبَّنَا وَأَطْهَرْ.</span>
>
> "This burden is not like the burden of Khaybar;<br/>
> This is more righteous from our Lord and purer."

And he would say:
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">اللَّهُمَّ إِنَّ الْأَجْرَ أَجْرُ الْآخِرَهْ، فَارْحَمِ الْأَنْصَارَ، وَالمُهَاجِرَهْ.</span>
>
> "O Allah, indeed the reward is the reward of the Hereafter,<br/>
> So have mercy on the Ansar and the Muhajirin."

Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated:
> "The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) arrived in Medina and stayed in the upper part of Medina, in a quarter called Banu Amr ibn Awf. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stayed there for fourteen nights. Then he sent for Banu al-Najjar, and they came carrying swords. I can almost see the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on his riding camel, with Abu Bakr riding behind him, and the nobles of Banu al-Najjar surrounding him until he dismounted in the courtyard of Abu Ayyub's house. The Prophet loved to pray wherever the prayer time found him, and he would pray even in sheep pens. He then ordered the construction of the Mosque. He sent for the leaders of Banu al-Najjar and said:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">«يَا بَنِي النَّجَّارِ ثَامِنُونِي بِحَائِطِكُمْ هَذَا»</span>
>
> 'O Banu al-Najjar, name a price for this garden of yours.'
>
> They said: 'No, by Allah, we seek no price for it except from Allah.' Anas said: 'It contained what I am telling you: graves of polytheists, ruins, and date palms. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered the graves of the polytheists to be dug up, then the ruins to be leveled, and the date palms to be cut down. They then arranged the date palms towards the Qiblah of the Mosque, and made its doorposts of stones. They began to carry rocks while reciting chants, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was with them, saying:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">اللَّهُمَّ لَا خَيْرَ إِلَّا خَيْرُ الآخِرَهْ، فَاغْفِرْ لِلأَنْصَارِ وَالمُهَاجِرَهْ.</span>
>
> 'O Allah, there is no good but the good of the Hereafter,<br/>
> So forgive the Ansar and the Muhajirin.'"

Abdullah ibn Umar said:
> "Indeed, the Mosque during the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was built with bricks, its roof was of palm fronds, and its pillars were of palm wood."
