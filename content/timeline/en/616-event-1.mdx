## The Prophet's Supplication and Umar's Aim

At-Tirmidhi narrated in his Sunan from Abdullah ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with both of them) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:
> **"O Allah, strengthen Islam with the more beloved of these two men to You: either Abu Jahl or Umar ibn al-Khattab."**
>
> He (the narrator) said: **"And the more beloved of them to Him was Umar."**

Historians of the Prophet's biography narrated that Umar one day **went out carrying his sword**, intending to eliminate the Prophet (peace be upon him).

## Encounter on the Way and a Shocking Discovery

He met a man who asked: **"Where are you heading, Umar?"**
He replied: **"I intend to kill Muhammad."**
The man said: **"How will you be safe from Banu Hashim and Banu Zuhrah after you have killed Muhammad?"**
Umar said to him: **"I see you have indeed apostatized and abandoned the religion you were upon."**
The man said: **"Shall I not tell you something astonishing, O Umar? Indeed, your sister and your brother-in-law have apostatized and abandoned the religion you are upon."**

So Umar walked towards them. **Khabbab ibn al-Aratt** was with them, holding a parchment on which **Surah [Taha]** was written, teaching it to them. When Khabbab heard Umar's presence, he hid inside the house, and Fatima, Umar's sister, concealed the parchment. Umar had heard Khabbab's recitation to them when he approached the house.

## His Sister's Courage, Fatima's Steadfastness, and His Conversion

When he entered upon them, he said: **"What is this humming I heard from you?"**
They replied: **"It was nothing but a conversation we were having amongst ourselves."**
He said: **"Perhaps you both have apostatized."**
His brother-in-law said to him: **"O Umar, what if the truth is in a religion other than yours?"**

Umar then leaped upon his brother-in-law and **trampled him severely**. His sister came and pulled him away from her husband, but Umar struck her with his hand, **bloodying her face**.
She said, while angry: **"O Umar, if the truth is in a religion other than yours, I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah."**

When Umar despaired and saw the blood on his sister, he felt **remorse and shame**, and said: **"Give me this book you have so I may read it."**
His sister said: **"You are impure, and none but the purified may touch it, so go and perform ghusl."**

He got up and performed ghusl, then took the book and read: **"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful."**
He said: **"Excellent and pure names."**

Then he read **[Taha]** until he reached the verse: **﴿Indeed, I am Allah. There is no deity except Me, so worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance.﴾**
He said: **"How beautiful and honorable is this speech? Guide me to Muhammad."**

So he went to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and **embraced Islam with him**. Then the Muslims went out with him in two rows until they entered the Mosque, and when Quraysh saw them, they were struck with **a gloom they had never experienced before**.
