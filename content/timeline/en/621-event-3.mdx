**Details of the Event:**
Abu Salama Abdullah ibn Abd al-Asad was the first of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from the Muhajireen of the Quraish, from the Banu Makhzum, to migrate to Medina. His migration to it was after the first pledge of Al-Aqabah and before the second pledge of Al-Aqabah, when the Quraish harmed him after his return from Abyssinia. So he resolved to return to it, then he heard that they had brothers in Medina, so he resolved to migrate to it.

Umm Salama said: When Abu Salama decided to go out to Medina, he saddled his camel for me, then mounted me on it, and put my son Salama ibn Abi Salama in my lap. Then he went out leading my camel, and the Banu Abd al-Asad set out with him, and the Banu al-Mughira detained me with them, and my husband Abu Salama went to Medina. She said: So I was separated from my son and my husband. She said: I used to go out every morning and sit in Al-Abtah, and I would continue to weep until evening, for a year or close to it, until a man from my cousins, one of the Banu al-Mughira, passed by me and saw my condition and had mercy on me. He said to the Banu al-Mughira:
>“Do you not feel ashamed of this poor woman? You have separated her from her husband and her child!”

She said:
>“So they said to me: Join your husband if you wish.”

She said:
>“So the Banu Abd al-Asad returned my son to me at that time. So I mounted my camel, then I took my son and put him in my lap, then I went out intending to join my husband in Medina. And no one from Allah's creation was with me, until I was in Al-Tan'im, and Uthman ibn Talha ibn Abi Talha, the brother of the Banu Abd al-Dar, met me. He said: ‘Where are you going, O daughter of Abi Umayya?’ I said: ‘I want to join my husband in Medina.’ He said: ‘Is no one with you?’ I said: ‘No one is with me except Allah and this son of mine.’ He said: ‘By Allah, you should not be left alone.’ So he took the reins of the camel and set off with me, hastening my pace. By Allah, I have never accompanied any man of the Arabs whom I thought was more noble than him. When he reached a resting place, he would make me dismount, then he would move away from me until I had dismounted, then he would move his camel away and unload it, then tie it to a tree, then he would go to a tree and lie down under it. When it was time to travel, he would go to my camel and bring it forward and saddle it, then he would move away from me and say: ‘Mount.’ When I had mounted and settled on my camel, he would come and take its reins and lead me until we reached the next resting place. He continued to do that for me until he brought me to Medina. When he saw the village of Banu Amr ibn Awf in Quba, he said: ‘Your husband is in this village.’ And Abu Salama was staying there, so enter it with the blessing of Allah. Then he turned back to Mecca.”

Umm Salama used to say:
>“I do not know of any household in Islam who suffered as much as the family of Abu Salama, and I have never seen a companion who was more noble than Uthman ibn Talha.”

Uthman ibn Talha ibn Abi Talha al-Abdari embraced Islam after Al-Hudaybiyya.
