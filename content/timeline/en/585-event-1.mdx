When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was approximately **14 or 15 years of age** (some accounts suggest he was around **20**), the significant conflict known as the **War of al-Fijaar** (The Sacrilegious War) erupted. This war pitted the Quraysh, along with their allies from the tribes of Kinaanah, against the tribe of Banoo Qays ‘Aylaan. This event holds considerable importance in Arab history and is documented amongst the notable "Days of the Arabs" (Ayyaam al-Arab).

The catalyst for this conflict involved an incident where **‘Urwaah al-Rahhaal ibn ‘Utbah ibn Rabee’a** leased a specialized container to **al-Nu’maan ibn al-Mundhir** for his trade in musk and similar goods. Subsequently, **al-Baraad ibn Qays**, a member of the Banoo Damrah tribe (part of Kinaanah), challenged ‘Urwaah’s dealings with those outside their tribal alliance, questioning his audacity to conduct business with anyone other than the sons of Kinaanah. ‘Urwaah retorted defiantly, asserting his right to trade with whomever he pleased.

Following this exchange, ‘Urwaah ibn al-Rahhaal departed the marketplace, as did al-Baraad, who lay in wait for an opportune moment. When ‘Urwaah reached the elevated area of Tayman Dhee Zhilaal and became momentarily distracted, al-Baraad ambushed and killed him. This act, committed during one of the sacred months, led to the conflict being known as "The Sacrilegious War" due to the violation of the sanctity of these months.

News of ‘Urwaah’s killing reached the Quraysh, stating that al-Barraad had committed the deed in the marketplace of ‘Ukaazh during a sacred month. Upon hearing this, the Quraysh mobilized before the Banoo Hawwaazin tribe was fully aware. Once the news reached the Banoo Hawwaazin, they pursued the Quraysh and their allies, catching up with them before they could reach the sanctuary of the Haram. A fierce battle ensued, lasting until nightfall. However, upon entering the Haram, the fighting ceased as the Banoo Hawaazin respected its sanctity. In the days that followed, the tribes met in various engagements, each fighting alongside their respective allies. Every tribe from Quraysh and Kinaanah had a leader, as did the tribe of Banoo Qays.

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ himself witnessed some of the events of this war, particularly the **Day of the Palm Tree (Yawm al-Nakhlah)**. At this time, his age was reported to be **14 years**, although some accounts place it closer to **20**.

After the cessation of hostilities and the departure of the tribes, during the month of Dhu’l-Qi’dah, the significant **Oath of the Righteous (Hilf al-Fudool)** took place. In this oath, the Quraysh pledged to always stand in support of the oppressed. This oath was prompted by an incident involving a man from Zabeed in Yemen who sold goods to a man from al-‘Aas ibn Waa’il al-Sahmee. Despite repeated requests for payment, the Yemeni man was consistently told he would be paid later. Eventually, Aboo Qubays stood on elevated ground and loudly proclaimed the injustice he had suffered. Moved by this, the Quraysh swore their oath to uphold justice, and the Prophet ﷺ was present at the swearing of this important oath.
