## Ending the Unjust Siege

After **two or three years of the oppressive siege** in Shi'b Abi Talib, the document was annulled, and the siege was lifted. Some members of Quraysh were pleased with this covenant, while others disliked it.

## Efforts to Annul the Document

Those who disliked the document strived to annul it. The leader of this effort was **Hisham ibn Amr from Banu Amir ibn Lu'ayy**. He used to secretly provide food to Banu Hashim in the valley at night.

Hisham went to **Zuhair ibn Abi Umayyah al-Makhzumi** (whose mother was Atikah bint Abd al-Muttalib) and said to him:
> "O Zuhair, are you content to eat food and drink beverages while your maternal uncles are in the state you know?"
>
> Zuhair replied: "Woe to you, what can I do as I am only one man? By Allah, if I had another man with me, I would rise to annul it."
>
> Hisham said: "You have found a man."
>
> Zuhair asked: "Who is he?"
>
> Hisham said: "I am."

Zuhair then said to him: **"Find us a third man."**

So Hisham went to **Al-Mut'im ibn Adi**, reminding him of the kinship with Banu Hashim and Banu al-Muttalib (the two sons of Abd Manaf), and rebuked him for his agreement with Quraysh on this injustice.
> Al-Mut'im said: "Woe to you, what can I do? I am only one man."
>
> Hisham said: "You have found a second."
>
> He asked: "Who is he?"
>
> Hisham said: "I am."
>
> He said: "Find us a third."
>
> Hisham said: "I have already done so."
>
> He asked: "Who is he?"
>
> Hisham said: "Zuhair ibn Abi Umayyah."
>
> He said: "Find us a fourth."

Then Hisham went to **Abu al-Bakhtari ibn Hisham**, and said to him something similar to what he had said to Al-Mut'im.
> He asked: "Is there anyone who will help with this?"
>
> Hisham said: "Yes."
>
> He asked: "Who is he?"
>
> Hisham said: "Zuhair ibn Abi Umayyah, and Al-Mut'im ibn Adi, and I am with you."
>
> He said: "Find us a fifth."

So Hisham went to **Zam'ah ibn al-Aswad ibn al-Muttalib ibn Asad**, spoke to him, and reminded him of their kinship and rights.
> He asked him: "Is there anyone else with you on this matter you are inviting me to?"
>
> Hisham said: "Yes." Then he named the others.

They gathered at Al-Hajun and made a pact to proceed with annulling the document. Zuhair said: **"I will begin for you and be the first to speak."**

## Confrontation in the Mosque and Annulment of the Document

When morning came, they went to their assemblies. Zuhair, wearing a fine garment, circumambulated the Kaaba seven times, then turned to the people and said:
> **"O people of Mecca, shall we eat food and wear clothes while Banu Hashim are perishing, with nothing sold to them or bought from them? By Allah, I will not sit down until this oppressive, cutting document is torn up."**

Abu Jahl, who was in a corner of the Mosque, said: **"You lie, by Allah, it will not be torn up."**
Zam'ah ibn al-Aswad said: **"You are the greater liar, by Allah, we did not approve of its writing when it was written."**
Abu al-Bakhtari said: **"Zam'ah spoke the truth, we do not approve of what was written in it, nor do we affirm it."**
Al-Mut'im ibn Adi said: **"You both spoke the truth, and whoever said otherwise lied. We disavow it and what was written in it before Allah."**
Hisham ibn Amr said something similar.
Abu Jahl then said: **"This is a matter decided by night, and conspired upon in another place."**

Abu Talib was sitting in a corner of the Mosque. He had come to them because Allah had informed His Messenger ﷺ about the matter of the document, and that **termites (al-arad) had eaten all of its injustice, severance, and oppression, except for the mention of Allah Almighty.** He then informed his uncle of this, who went to Quraysh and told them that his nephew had said such and such.
> "If he is a liar, we will leave him to you, but if he is truthful, you must cease your boycott and oppression of us."
>
> They said: "You have been fair."

After the discussion between the people and Abu Jahl, Al-Mut'im went to the document to tear it. He **found that the termites had eaten it all except for "(In Your Name, O Allah)"**, and whatever contained the name of Allah was not eaten.

Then he annulled the document, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and those with him came out of the valley. The polytheists had seen a great sign from the signs of his prophethood, but as Allah informed about them: **﴿And if they see a sign, they turn away and say, "Continuous magic."﴾** They turned away from this sign and increased in their disbelief.
