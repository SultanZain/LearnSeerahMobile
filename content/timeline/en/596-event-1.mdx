**Details of the Event:**

When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reached the age of twenty-five, and he was known in Makkah only as "Al-Amin" (the trustworthy) due to the perfection of his noble qualities, his uncle Abu Talib said to him:

> “O my nephew, I am a man of little wealth, and hard times have befallen us, with severe years pressing upon us. We have neither resources nor trade. Now, your people's caravan is preparing to depart for Syria, and Khadijah bint Khuwaylid sends men from your tribe with her caravans, and they trade with her wealth and gain profits. If you were to approach her and offer your services, she would readily accept you and prefer you over others because of what has reached her about your purity. Though I dislike for you to go to Syria and fear the Jews for you, we have no other choice.”

Khadijah bint Khuwaylid was a noble and wealthy businesswoman with extensive trade that she would send to Syria. Her caravan was like any other large caravan of the Quraysh. She used to hire men and give them her wealth on a profit-sharing basis. News of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ's truthfulness, great trustworthiness, and noble character reached Khadijah, so she sent him to trade on her behalf.

He ﷺ set out with her servant Maysarah until they reached Syria. His uncles had instructed the people of the caravan to take good care of him. When they arrived in Busra, they rested in the shade of a tree near a monk's hermitage called Nastura. The monk looked at Maysarah—whom he knew—and said: **“O Maysarah, who is this who has rested under this tree?”** Maysarah replied: **“A man from the Quraysh, from the people of the sanctuary.”** The monk said to him: **“None has ever rested under this tree except a Prophet.”**

Then, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sold his goods—his merchandise that he had taken—and bought what he intended to buy. Then he returned with the caravan to Makkah, accompanied by Maysarah. When he presented Khadijah with her wealth in Makkah, she sold what he had brought for double or close to double the profit. Maysarah narrated to her what the monk had said and what he had witnessed of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ's affairs.

Thereupon, Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her) proposed marriage to him. She was the most distinguished woman of the Quraysh in lineage, the greatest in honor, and the wealthiest. When she conveyed this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, he mentioned it to his uncles. His uncle Hamzah went with him until they entered upon Khuwaylid ibn Asad and proposed marriage to her on his behalf. The Prophet ﷺ then married her, and she was the first woman he married. He did not marry another woman until she passed away (may Allah be pleased with her).
