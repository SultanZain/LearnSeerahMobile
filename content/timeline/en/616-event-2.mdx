## Quraysh's Warning and Protection from "Magic"

Quraysh was **strongly warning people against listening to the Prophet ﷺ**. When At-Tufail ibn Amr Ad-Dausi arrived in Mecca, he was a noble, eloquent poet. Men from Quraysh approached him.

> They said to him: "O Tufail, you have come to our land, and this man among us has caused us **great trouble – his matter has become severe** – and he has divided our community and scattered our affairs. His speech is like magic; it separates a man from his father, a man from his brother, and a man from his wife. We fear for you and your people what has afflicted us, so **do not speak to him or listen to anything from him**."

At-Tufail narrated:
> "By Allah, they did not cease to urge me until I resolved not to listen to anything from him or speak to him. So much so that **I stuffed my ears with cotton when I went to the Mosque, for fear that any of his words might reach me, and I did not want to hear him**."

## A Predestined Listening and the Light of Truth

Despite his precautions, Allah willed that At-Tufail listen to the Prophet ﷺ.
> "So I went to the Mosque, and behold, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was standing, praying near the Kaaba. He said: I stood near him, and **Allah willed nothing but that I hear some of his words**. He said: I heard beautiful speech."

At this point, he began to reproach himself, being a discerning and insightful man:
> "I said to myself: Woe to my mother! By Allah, I am an intelligent poet; good and bad are not hidden from me. **What prevents me from listening to what this man says? If what he brings is good, I will accept it, and if it is bad, I will leave it**."

At-Tufail remained until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ departed for his home, and he followed him.

## The Presentation of Islam and the Miracle of Light

When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ entered his house, At-Tufail entered upon him and said:
> "O Muhammad, your people said such and such to me, for what they said; by Allah, they did not stop trying to frighten me about your matter until **I plugged my ears with cotton so that I would not hear your words**. Then **Allah willed nothing but that I hear your words, and I heard beautiful speech, so present your matter to me**."

At-Tufail said:
> "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ presented Islam to me and recited the Quran to me, and **by Allah, I have never heard speech more beautiful than it, nor a matter more just than it**. So I embraced Islam and bore witness to the truth."

After accepting Islam, At-Tufail asked for a sign to aid him in inviting his people:
> He said: "O Prophet of Allah, I am a man obeyed among my people, and I am returning to them, inviting them to Islam. **So pray to Allah to grant me a sign that will be an aid to me against them in what I invite them to**."
> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"O Allah, grant him a sign."**

At-Tufail then set out for his people.
> He said: "When I reached a mountain pass – **the gap between two mountains** – that overlooked the encampment – **meaning, the people residing by the water** – **a light appeared between my eyes like a lamp**. I said: O Allah, not on my face, for I fear they will think it is a disfigurement that has befallen my face for abandoning their religion. He said: **So it shifted and settled on the tip of my whip**."

This light became a clear sign for his people:
> He said: "The people present began to see that light on my whip like a hanging lamp, as I descended to them from the mountain pass. He said: until I reached them and was among them by morning."

## The Islam of His Father and Wife, and the Invitation to His Tribe

Upon his arrival, his father and wife were the first to embrace Islam through him:
> When I arrived, my father came to me; he was an old man. I said: "Keep away from me, O my father, for I am not from you, and you are not from me."
> He asked: "Why, my son?"
> I replied: **"I have embraced Islam and followed the religion of Muhammad ﷺ."**
> He said: "My son, then **my religion is your religion**."
> I said: "Then go and wash yourself and purify your clothes, then come so I may teach you what I have learned."
> He went and washed himself, purified his clothes, then came, and I presented Islam to him, and **he embraced Islam**.

Then his wife came:
> "Then my companion – **my wife** – came to me, and I said: Keep away from me, for I am not from you, and you are not from me. She asked: Why, by my father and mother? I replied: Islam has separated between me and you, and I have followed the religion of Muhammad ﷺ. She said: **Then my religion is your religion**. I said: Then go and purify yourself. So she went and performed ghusl, then came, and I presented Islam to her, and **she embraced Islam**."

Then he invited his tribe, Daus, to Islam, but they were slow to respond.
> He said: "Then I came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in Mecca, and I said to him: O Prophet of Allah, indeed **adultery – amusement with preoccupation of heart and sight** – has overcome Daus, so pray to Allah against them."
> He said: **"O Allah, guide Daus. Return to your people, invite them, and be gentle with them."**

At-Tufail continued to invite them:
> He said: "I continued to invite them to Islam in the land of Daus until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ migrated to Medina, and Badr, Uhud, and Al-Khandaq passed. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ with those of my people who had embraced Islam with me, while the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was at Khaybar. I arrived in Medina with seventy or eighty households from Daus, then we joined the Messenger of Allah ﷺ at Khaybar, and he allotted shares to us along with the Muslims."

## His Martyrdom in the Path of Allah

At-Tufail (may Allah be pleased with him) remained with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ until Allah granted him the conquest of Mecca. He was with him in Medina until Allah took the soul of His Messenger ﷺ. When the Arabs apostatized, he went out with the Muslims, marching with them until they completed the matter of **Tulaiha** and all the land of **Najd**. Then he marched with the Muslims to **Al-Yamamah**, and **was martyred there**.
