**Details of the Event:**

On the authority of Mujahid, from his freed slave who narrated to him: that he was among those who were rebuilding the Ka'bah in the pre-Islamic era... He said:

> "We built until we reached the place of the Black Stone, and no one could see the Stone. Then, suddenly, it was in the middle of our stones, like the size of a man's head, with what looked like the face of a man almost visible on it. A clan of Quraysh said: 'We will place it.' Another group said: 'We will place it.' So they said: 'Appoint a judge between you.' They said: 'The first man to emerge from the pass.' Then the Prophet ﷺ came, and they said: 'The trustworthy one has come to you.' They told him the situation, so he placed the Stone in a garment, then called the heads of their clans, and they took hold of its corners with him, and then he ﷺ placed it."
