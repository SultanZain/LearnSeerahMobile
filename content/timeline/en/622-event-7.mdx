**Details of the Event:**

When the polytheists saw that the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had prepared and departed, taking with them their offspring, children, and wealth to the Aws and Khazraj in Yathrib (Medina), they were overcome with sadness and anxiety. Concern and worry filled them, so the tyrants of Mecca gathered in Dar al-Nadwah (the House of Assembly) to make a decisive decision regarding this matter. Their meeting was approximately two and a half months after the Pledge of Aqabah. All the representatives of the Quraishi tribes converged for this meeting to discuss a decisive plan that would swiftly ensure the elimination of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his message.

When they arrived at Dar al-Nadwah as agreed, Iblis (Satan) appeared to them in the guise of a venerable old man and stood at the door. They asked: "Who is this old man?" He said: "An old man from the people of Najd. I heard what you have gathered for and came to be with you to hear what you say. Perhaps I can offer you an opinion and advice." They said: "Yes, come in." So, he entered with them.

After the meeting was complete and the discussion had gone on for a long time:

Abu al-Aswad said:
> "Let us expel him from among us and banish him from our land. We will not care where he goes or where he lands. We will have set our affairs right, and our unity will be restored as it was."

The old man from Najd (Iblis) said:
> "No, by Allah, this is not a good opinion for you. Have you not seen the beauty of his speech, the sweetness of his words, and his mastery over the hearts of men with what he brings? By Allah, if you were to do that, you would not be safe from him settling among another Arab tribe, and then he would lead them against you – after they follow him – until he would tread upon you in your own land, and then he would do with you as he wished. Devise an opinion other than this."

Abu al-Bakhtari said:
> "Imprison him in chains and lock a door upon him, then wait for him to meet the same fate as the poets before him – like Zuhayr and al-Nabigha – and those who passed away from this death, until he meets what they met."

The old man from Najd said:
> "No, by Allah, this is not a good opinion for you. By Allah, if you imprison him as you say, his matter will certainly escape from behind the door you locked him behind to his companions, and they will soon rise up against you, snatch him from your hands, and then overwhelm you with him until they conquer you in your affair. This is not a good opinion for you; look for something else."

After that, the chief criminal of Mecca, Abu Jahl ibn Hisham, presented a sinful proposal that all those present agreed upon. Abu Jahl said:
> "By Allah, I have an opinion about him that I don't think you have come across yet."

They asked: "What is it, O Abul Hakam?" He said:
> "I suggest that we take a vigorous, strong, noble, and influential young man from every tribe among us, and then we give each young man a sharp sword. Then they should all aim for him and strike him with it as one man and kill him, and we will be rid of him. For if they do that, his blood will be distributed among all the tribes, and Banu Abd Manaf will not be able to wage war against all their people. So, they will accept blood money from us, and we will pay it to them."

The old man from Najd said:
> "The saying is what this man said. This is the only opinion; there is no other."

And they unanimously agreed upon this sinful proposal.
