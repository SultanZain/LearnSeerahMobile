**Details of the Event:**

Nine months after the Hijrah, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) dispatched **Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas** (may Allah be pleased with him) at the head of a military mission to **al-Kharrar**—a valley that serves as a route toward al-Juhfah.

The key aspects of this expedition include:
* **Composition:** The group consisted of **twenty riders**, all of whom were from the *Muhajirin* (some reports suggest they were only eight).
* **The Banner:** The Prophet ﷺ handed Sa’d a **white banner**, which was carried by **al-Miqdad ibn ‘Amr** (may Allah be pleased with him).
* **The Strategy:** The Prophet ﷺ strictly instructed Sa’d <u>not to exceed</u> the limits of the valley. To maintain secrecy, the companions:
    1. Marched on foot.
    2. *Concealed themselves* during the day.
    3. Traveled only during the night.

They reached the location on the morning of the fifth day; however, they discovered that the Quraysh caravan they intended to intercept had passed by the previous day. Consequently, the expedition returned to **Medina** without engaging in any combat.
