## The Journey to Ta'if and the Call to Islam

The Prophet ﷺ set out for Ta'if, which is about **sixty miles** from Mecca. He walked this distance back and forth, accompanied by his freed slave **Zayd ibn Harithah**.

Whenever he passed by a tribe on the way, **he invited them to Islam, but none of them responded positively**.

Upon reaching Ta'if, he **approached its leaders and invited them, but they did not respond**. He stayed among the people of Ta'if for ten days, not leaving any of their noblemen without visiting and speaking to him.

## The Harm Inflicted by the Rabble of Ta'if and the Ordeal of Suffering

They told him: **"Get out of our land."** And they incited their foolish people against him.

When he intended to leave, their foolish people and slaves followed him, **insulting him and yelling at him**, until people gathered around him. They stood in **two rows (simatayn)** and began to pelt him with stones and foolish words. **They stoned his ankles until his sandals were stained with blood**.

**Zayd ibn Harithah protected him with his own body** until he sustained head injuries. The foolish people continued to harass him until they forced him into a garden belonging to Utbah and Shaybah, the sons of Rabi'ah, about three miles from Ta'if.

## The Prophet's ﷺ Mercy and the Prayer for Guidance

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ returned on the road to Mecca after leaving the garden, **distressed, sorrowful, and broken-hearted**.

When he reached **Qarn al-Manazil**, Allah sent Jibreel (Gabriel) to him, accompanied by the Angel of the Mountains, seeking his permission to **bring down the two mountains (Akhshabayn) upon the people of Mecca**.

The Prophet ﷺ replied:
> **"No, rather I hope that Allah Almighty will bring forth from their loins those who will worship Allah Almighty alone and associate nothing with Him."**

In this response given by the Messenger ﷺ, his **unique personality and his magnificent character are clearly manifested**.
