As the Prophet ﷺ reached the age of **twelve**, his caring uncle, **Aboo Taalib**, embarked on a trading journey to **Al-Shaam** (Greater Syria), and he thoughtfully took his nephew along. When their caravan reached **Busra**, they encountered a knowledgeable monk named **Baheera**. This monk possessed profound understanding of the Gospel and the tenets of Christianity.

Upon observing the young Prophet ﷺ, **Baheera** began to keenly study his features and then engaged him in conversation. Subsequently, he turned to **Aboo Taalib** and inquired: **“Is this boy yours?”** Out of his deep affection and care for him, Aboo Taalib replied: **“He is my son.”**

However, **Baheera**, with his insightful knowledge, stated: **“This cannot be your son; it is not possible that this boy’s father is still alive.”** Aboo Taalib then clarified that the young Muhammad ﷺ was indeed his brother’s son. To this, **Baheera** asked: **“What then happened to his father?”** Aboo Taalib explained: **“He passed away while his mother was still pregnant with him.”**

**Baheera** affirmed: **“That is correct…return with him to his land and safeguard him from the Jews. I swear by Allah, if they were to see him and recognize who he truly is, they would undoubtedly plot evil against him. Verily, this boy being your brother’s son is a matter of great significance.”**

Heeding the monk’s grave warning, **Aboo Taalib** hastened their return to Makkah.
