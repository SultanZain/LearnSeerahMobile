When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reached the age of **eight**, a new chapter unfolded in his young life with the passing of his beloved grandfather. As per his grandfather's wise counsel, the Prophet ﷺ was entrusted into the care of his uncle, **Aboo Taalib** (born c. 539), son of ‘Abdul-Muttalib. The bond between the Prophet’s father, Abdullah, and Aboo Taalib was particularly strong, as they shared the same mother. Thus, upon Abdul-Mutallib's demise, the responsibility for the Prophet’s well-being naturally fell to Aboo Taalib.

**Ibn Sa’d** and **Ibn ‘Asaakir**, among others, narrated on the authority of **Ibn ‘Abbaas** (may Allah be well pleased with them both):

> “When Abdul-Muttalib passed away, Aboo Taalib took the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to be under his care. Aboo Taalib held him in deep affection, a love that surpassed even that for his own sons. He would not sleep unless the Prophet ﷺ was by his side, and he ensured that food was always set aside for him ﷺ. When Aboo Taalib’s sons would dine together or individually, they made a point of not eating to their full capacity. However, if the Messenger of Allah ﷺ joined them, they would eat until they were completely satisfied. Whenever Aboo Taalib intended to serve them lunch or dinner, he would instruct them: **“Not until my son has arrived.”** Upon the Prophet’s ﷺ arrival, they would all sit together, and Aboo Taalib would offer him food from their portion. If the Prophet ﷺ was absent, he would not allow his own children to eat their fill.

> Furthermore, if there was milk available, it would be served to the children in a large drinking-bowl. The Prophet ﷺ would drink first, and then the other children would partake from the same bowl, one after another, and be fully satisfied. Yet, if they drank without the Prophet ﷺ, a single bowl would never suffice. Observing this remarkable blessing, Aboo Taalib would often exclaim: **“Verily you are blessed!”**”
