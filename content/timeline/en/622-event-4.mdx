**Details of the Event:**

Ibn Ishaq said:

> "The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wrote a document between the Muhajireen and the Ansar, in which he made a covenant with the Jews, granting them peace, affirming them in their religion and their possessions, and stipulating conditions for them and upon them."

This treaty was established when the Jews refused to follow Islam, and it was before the permission for fighting and taking Jizyah (tribute) from those who refused Islam. Most of them insisted on disbelief. There were three main Jewish tribes in Medina: Banu Qaynuqa', Banu an-Nadir, and Banu Qurayza. All three tribes eventually engaged in hostilities against the Prophet (ﷺ).

The Prophet (ﷺ) showed clemency towards Banu Qaynuqa', expelled Banu an-Nadir, and fought and killed the men of Banu Qurayza, taking their descendants captive due to their treachery.

Regarding these events, Allah revealed:

**Surah Al-Hashr (Chapter of the Gathering), which describes the expulsion of Banu an-Nadir:**

> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">هُوَ الَّذِي أَخْرَجَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ مِن دِيَارِهِمْ لِأَوَّلِ الْحَشْرِ <span>٢</span></span>

"It is He who expelled the ones who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture from their homes at the first gathering."

**Surah Al-Ahzab (Chapter of the Confederates), which addresses the treachery of Banu Qurayza during the Battle of the Trench:**

> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">وَأَنزَلَ الَّذِينَ ظَاهَرُوهُم مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ مِن صَيَاصِيهِمْ وَقَذَفَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الرُّعْبَ فَرِيقًا تَقْتُلُونَ وَتَأْسِرُونَ فَرِيقًا <span>٢٦</span></span>

"And He brought down those who supported them among the People of the Scripture from their fortresses and cast terror into their hearts. A party you killed, and a party you took captive."
