**Details of the Event:**

Abdullah ibn Salam (may Allah be pleased with him) was a learned scholar among the Jews. He narrated his journey to Islam, saying:

> When I heard about the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), I recognized his description, his name, and the time he was expected to appear, which we had been awaiting. I kept this knowledge to myself, silent about it, until the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) arrived in Medina. When he disembarked in Quba, among the Banu Amr ibn Awf, a man came and informed me of his arrival. I was at the top of my date palm, working, with my aunt Khalidah bint Al-Harith sitting beneath me. When I heard the news of the Messenger of Allah's (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) arrival, I exclaimed 'Allahu Akbar' (Allah is the Greatest)! My aunt, upon hearing my exclamation, said to me: 'May Allah disappoint you! By Allah, had you heard of Musa ibn Imran coming, you would not have exclaimed more!' I replied to her: 'O aunt, by Allah, he is the brother of Musa ibn Imran, and he is upon his religion, sent with what Musa was sent with.' She then asked: 'O son of my brother, is he the Prophet about whom we were told he would be sent just before the Hour?' I said to her: 'Yes.' She replied: 'Then that is he.'

Abdullah ibn Salam continued:

> "Then I went out to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and accepted Islam. After that, I returned to my household and commanded them, and they too embraced Islam."

He further recounted:

> I kept my conversion a secret from the Jews. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said to him: 'O Messenger of Allah, the Jews are a people of slander, and I would like you to let me hide in one of your houses, concealed from them. Then you can ask them about me, so they may tell you how I am among them, before they know about my conversion; for if they knew, they would slander and defame me.' So, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) let me enter one of his houses. The Jews then came to him, spoke with him, and questioned him. Then he asked them: 'What kind of man is Abdullah ibn Salam among you?' They replied: 'He is our master and the son of our master, our scholar and our wise man.' When they finished their praises, I came out before them and said to them: 'O assembly of Jews, fear Allah and accept what has come to you! By Allah, you certainly know that he is the Messenger of Allah, you find him written with his name and description in the Torah with you. Indeed, I bear witness that he is the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and I believe in him, affirm him, and recognize him.' They immediately responded: 'You lied!' Then they began to revile me. I then said to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 'Did I not tell you, O Messenger of Allah, that they are a slanderous people, treacherous, liars, and corrupt!' Then I openly declared my Islam and the Islam of my household, and my aunt Khalidah bint Al-Harith also embraced Islam, and her Islam was excellent.
