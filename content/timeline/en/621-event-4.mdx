**Details of the Event:**
After the first pledge of Al-Aqabah, the Ansar wrote to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asking him to send them someone to lead them in prayer and teach them the Quran. So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent them Mus'ab ibn Umayr, who stayed as a guest with As'ad ibn Zurarah. Mus'ab began to call people to Islam, and Islam spread among the people of Yathrib until there was no house in Yathrib but that there was a Muslim man or woman in it. Among those who embraced Islam at his hands were the two leaders of the Aws tribe, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh and Usayd ibn al-Hudayr.
