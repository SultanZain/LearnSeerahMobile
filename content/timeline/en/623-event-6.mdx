**Details of the Event:**

In the month of **Rabi' al-Akhir, 2 AH**, the Prophet ﷺ led an expedition to **Buwat**, a mountainous region belonging to the Juhaynah tribe near Yanbu'. The primary objective was to intercept a trade caravan led by **al-Majdi ibn 'Amr al-Juhani**.

**The Hardship of the Journey:**
The Sahaba faced significant resource shortages during this mission. Jabir ibn Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that:
* Equipment was scarce.
* **Five, six, or even seven men** had to share a single camel, taking turns to ride.

**The Lesson on Speech and Supplication:**
During this journey, an incident occurred that led to a profound prophetic teaching. An Ansari man, struggling with his hesitant camel, cursed the animal.

> "Do not curse yourselves, nor your children, nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may coincide with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded to."

Upon hearing the curse, the Prophet ﷺ ordered the man to dismount and <u>not accompany the army with a 'cursed' animal</u>, teaching the believers the importance of **disciplining the tongue** and avoiding ill-wishes during moments of frustration.
