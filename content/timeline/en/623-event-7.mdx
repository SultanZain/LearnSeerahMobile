**Details of the Event:**

The Battle of **al-Ushayrah** (also pronounced as al-Usayrah) took place in the second year of Hijrah, prior to the Great Battle of Badr. According to the companion Zayd ibn Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him), this was the first battle he witnessed alongside the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.

**The Journey and Landmarks:**
The Prophet ﷺ took a specific route characterized by several historical stops:
* He passed through **Naqb Bani Dinar** and **Fayfa’ al-Khabar**.
* He rested under a tree in the valley of Ibn Azhar, at a place called **Dhat al-Saq**, where he offered prayers and shared a meal with his companions.
* He drank from the waters of **al-Mushtarib** and the well at **ad-Dabu'ah**.
* He traversed the plain of **Mulal** before reaching the destination of al-Ushayrah in the valley of Yanbu'.

**Diplomatic Outcomes:**
The Prophet ﷺ remained at al-Ushayrah for the entirety of Jumada al-Ula and part of Jumada al-Akhirah. During this period:
1. He established a **peace treaty** with the tribe of **Bani Mudlij**.
2. He reaffirmed the alliance with their partners, **Bani Dumrah**.

> "The expedition concluded successfully as a strategic diplomatic mission, and the Prophet ﷺ returned to Medina without any military conflict or outbreak of fighting."
