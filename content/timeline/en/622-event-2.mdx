**Details of the Event:**
Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him):
>“The moon was split into two halves during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, **‘Bear witness.’**”

Narrated Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him):
>“The people of Mecca asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to show them a sign, so he showed them the moon split into two halves, until they saw Hira' between them.”

In Sahih Muslim, Abdullah ibn Mas'ud narrated:
>“The moon was split into two during the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). One part was behind the mountain, and the other part was above the mountain. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, **‘O Allah, bear witness.’**”

The well-known opinion is that the splitting of the moon occurred once. As for what is mentioned in one of the narrations of Muslim:
>(...so he showed them the splitting of the moon twice).

The scholars have responded to this. Ibn al-Qayyim, Ibn Hajar, and others have considered it more likely that it occurred once.
