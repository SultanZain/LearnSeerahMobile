**Details of the Event:**

In the month of Sha'ban, eight months after the Hijrah, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) dispatched a military expedition led by **'Ubaydah ibn al-Harith ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib** to Batn Rabigh. This location serves as the Miqat for pilgrims from Ash-Sham, Egypt, and Turkey.

The Prophet ﷺ entrusted 'Ubaydah with a white banner, carried by Mistah ibn Uthathah. The detachment consisted of **sixty Muhajirin** (Emigrants), with no one from the Ansar among them. They encountered a group of two hundred men from the Quraysh led by Abu Sufyan ibn Harb. Although the two groups met, no full-scale battle ensued; instead, it was a skirmish involving the exchange of arrows. During this expedition, **Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas** (may Allah be pleased with him) earned the distinction of being the first person to shoot an arrow in the cause of Allah. Eventually, both parties retreated to their respective camps without engaging in sword combat.
