**Details of the Event:**

Narrated Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her):

> "The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the Muslims:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">«إِنِّي أُرِيتُ دَارَ هِجْرَتِكُمْ ذَاتَ نَخْلٍ بَيْنَ لاَبَتَيْنِ»</span>
>
> 'I have been shown the land of your migration: a land of date palms between two black stony tracts.'
>
> These two were the two Harrahs (volcanic plains). So, whoever wished to migrate did so towards Medina, and the majority of those who had migrated to Abyssinia returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also prepared to migrate towards Medina. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">«عَلَى رِسْلِكَ، فَإِنِّي أَرْجُو أَنْ يُؤْذَنَ لِي»</span>
>
> 'Take your time, for I hope that I will be given permission (to migrate).'
>
> Abu Bakr asked: 'Do you hope for that, may my father be sacrificed for you?' He said:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">«نَعَمْ»</span>
>
> 'Yes.'
>
> So, Abu Bakr restrained himself for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in order to accompany him, and he fed two riding camels he had with Samur leaves – which is called Al-Khabat – for four months."

Ibn Shihab said: Urwah said: Aisha narrated:

> "While we were one day sitting in Abu Bakr's house at noon, someone said to Abu Bakr: 'This is the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), covered, coming at an hour he usually did not visit us.' Abu Bakr said: 'May my father and mother be sacrificed for him! By Allah, nothing but an important matter has brought him at this hour.' Aisha said: 'So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came and asked for permission, and he was admitted. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Abu Bakr:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">«أَخْرِجْ مَن عِنْدَكَ»</span>
>
> 'Ask those who are with you to leave.'
>
> Abu Bakr said: 'They are only your family, may my father be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah.' He said:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">«فَإِنِّي قَدْ أُذِنَ لِي فِي الخُرُوجِ»</span>
>
> 'Indeed, I have been given permission to depart.'
>
> Abu Bakr asked: 'The companionship, may my father be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah?' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">«نَعَمْ»</span>
>
> 'Yes.'
>
> Abu Bakr said: 'Then take – may my father be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah – one of these two riding camels of mine.' The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">«بِالثَّمَنِ»</span>
>
> 'For its price.'
>
> Aisha said: 'So we prepared them with the utmost readiness, and we made a provisions bag for them. Asma bint Abi Bakr cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of the bag with it, and for this, she was named 'Dhat al-Nitaqayn' (The One of the Two Belts).' Aisha continued: 'Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr caught up with a cave in Mount Thawr, and they hid in it for three nights. Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr, a young, intelligent, and perceptive man, would spend the night with them. He would leave them at dawn and spend the morning with Quraish in Mecca as if he had spent the night there. He would not hear of any plot against them except that he would remember it, until he would bring them the news when darkness fell. Amir ibn Fuhayrah, Abu Bakr's freed slave, would graze a flock of sheep for them, and he would bring them back when an hour of the evening had passed. They would spend the night sustained by the milk and fresh butter from his flock, until Amir ibn Fuhayrah would drive them away at dawn. He would do this every night for those three nights. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr hired a man from Banu al-Dīl, from Banu Abd ibn Adi, a skilled guide – Al-Khirrit is one who is expert in guiding – who had a sworn alliance with the family of Al-As ibn Wa'il as-Sahmi. He was on the religion of the polytheists of Quraish. They trusted him and handed over their two riding camels to him, and they agreed to meet him at the cave of Thawr after three nights, with their two camels on the morning of the third day. Amir ibn Fuhayrah and the guide went with them, and he took them by the coastal route."

Suraqah ibn Ju'shum narrated:

> "The messengers of the Quraish disbelievers came to us, offering the blood money of each of them for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr, to whoever killed or captured him. While I was sitting in a gathering of my people, Banu Mudlij, a man from them approached until he stood over us while we were sitting, and he said: 'O Suraqah, I just saw some black figures on the coast, I think they are Muhammad and his companions.' Suraqah said: 'I knew it was them, but I said to him: 'They are not them, but you saw so-and-so, they went off before our very eyes.' Then I waited in the gathering for an hour, then I got up and went inside and ordered my slave-girl to take my horse out for me from behind a hill and keep it ready for me. I took my spear and went out with it from the back of the house, dragging its tip on the ground and lowering its upper part, until I reached my horse and mounted it. I made it gallop fast until I got close to them. Then my horse stumbled with me, and I fell from it. I got up and put my hand to my quiver, took out the arrows for divination, and sought an omen: 'Shall I harm them or not?' The result was what I disliked. I mounted my horse and disobeyed the omen, making it gallop fast. When I heard the recitation of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he did not turn around, but Abu Bakr kept looking back. My horse's forelegs sank into the ground up to its knees, and I fell from it. Then I scolded it, and it stood up, barely managing to pull out its forelegs. When it stood straight, there was a rising cloud of dust from its forelegs like smoke in the sky. I sought an omen again with the arrows, and the result was what I disliked. So I called out to them for safety, and they stopped. I mounted my horse until I reached them. It occurred to me when I encountered what I encountered in being stopped from reaching them that the matter of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would prevail. So I said to him: 'Your people have set a blood money for you,' and I informed them of the news of what people intended against them, and I offered them provisions and supplies. They did not take anything from me nor did they ask, except that he (the Prophet) said:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">«أَخْفِ عَنَّا»</span>
>
> 'Keep our matter secret.'
>
> I asked him to write a letter of security for me. He ordered Amir ibn Fuhayrah to write it on a piece of leather. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) proceeded."

From Urwah ibn al-Zubayr:

> "The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) met Al-Zubayr in a caravan of Muslims who were merchants returning from Syria. Al-Zubayr clothed the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr in white garments. The Muslims in Medina heard of the Messenger of Allah's (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) departure from Mecca, so they would go out every morning to Al-Harrah (the stony plain) and wait for him until the heat of noon would force them back. One day, after a long wait, they returned to their homes. When they had settled in, a man from the Jews ascended one of their forts to look at something. He caught sight of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions, appearing bright white, moving through the shimmering mirage. The Jew could not help but shout at the top of his voice:
>
> <span className="font-quran" dir="rtl">يَا مَعَاشِرَ الْعَرَبِ، هَذَا جَدُّكُمُ الَّذِي تَنتَظِرُونَ</span>
>
> 'O assembly of Arabs, this is your grandfather (i.e., your desired one) whom you were waiting for!'
>
> The Muslims rushed to their weapons and met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at the outskirts of Al-Harrah. He then turned with them to the right, until he dismounted with them among Banu Amr ibn Awf. This was on a Monday in the month of Rabi' al-Awwal. Abu Bakr stood for the people, while the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent. Those Ansar who had not seen the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) began to greet Abu Bakr, until the sun struck the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Abu Bakr then came and shaded him with his cloak. It was then that the people recognized the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)."
