### Birth and Lineage

Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) was born in Mecca in the year 570 CE, an era famously known as the *Year of the Elephant*. This name commemorates the miraculous event where an army, led by Abraha and featuring elephants, attempting to destroy the Ka'bah, was thwarted by divine intervention.

He belonged to the noble **Banu Hashim** clan, a respected and influential branch of the larger **Quraysh** tribe, which held custodianship over the Ka'bah. His esteemed lineage traces back to Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham), through his son Isma'il (Ishmael), connecting him to a long line of prophets and righteous individuals.

### Childhood and Upbringing

The Prophet's (PBUH) early life was marked by significant losses. His father, Abdullah, passed away before his birth. His mother, Aminah, died when he was merely six years old. Following these events, he was lovingly cared for by his grandfather, Abdul-Muttalib. After his grandfather's passing, the responsibility of his upbringing was shouldered by his uncle, Abu Talib, who provided him with protection and support.

Even as a youth, Muhammad (PBUH) was renowned throughout Mecca for his impeccable character. He was distinguished by his unwavering **truthfulness**, **honesty**, and **integrity**. These virtues earned him the honorable titles of **Al-Amin** (the trustworthy) and **As-Sadiq** (the truthful) long before he received prophethood. His reputation was such that people would entrust him with their valuables for safekeeping.

> "Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often." (Quran 33:21)

His early experiences, including his work as a shepherd and later as a merchant, helped shape his understanding of people and society, preparing him for the great responsibility that lay ahead.
